# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
    # Room.create(room_name: 'Ruby on Rails Room',
    #             location: 'Building C',
    #             description: 'Perfect room for small gatherings. Features a whiteboard and projector.
    #             Design accents include an open ceiling concept and glass wall',
    #             )
